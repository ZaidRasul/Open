## 📂 Repository Structure
- `python/` → Python programs  
- `javascript/` → JavaScript programs  
- `algorithms/` → Common algorithms in any language  
- `projects/` → Small apps, CLI tools, or experiments  
- `docs/` → Guides, notes, or tutorials  
- `Rust/` →  Rust programs  
- Or any other language of your choice. If the folder doesn't exist create one. 
    So the structure of repository remains consistent

## 🎯 Contribution Guidelines
- Keep your code clean and well-documented.  
- Use meaningful file names (e.g., `fibonacci.py` not `script1.py`).  
- Add comments where necessary to help beginners understand.  
- If submitting a project, include a short `README.md` explaining how it works.
